ESCToken is a community-driven, fair start DeFi project. Each transaction has four simple functions: FOMO, LP acquisition, static reward and destruction. The transaction fee for buying is 10%, and the fee for selling or transferring is 10%-30%. Among them, 1%-5% is transferred to the fomo bonus pool, 2% is transferred to community operations, 3%-11% is transferred to the locked liquidity pool, and 4%-12% is used for all $ESCT holders.
