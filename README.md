# ESCToken is a community-driven, fair-launched DeFi project. Four simple functions occur during each trade: FOMO, LP Acquisition, Static Reward & Burn. The minimum fee of any single transaction is 10%, and the maximum fee is 30%. Among them, 1%-5% is transferred to the fomo bonus pool, 2% to community operation, 3%-11% to the locked liquidity pool, and 4%-12% as static reward for all $ESCT holders with the Black Hole being one of them.
